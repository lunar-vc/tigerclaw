# Daivik Patel -- ENGRAM Co-Author & Param Co-Founder

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Analyst:** Claude (Tigerclaw)
**Type:** Founder Research

## Executive Summary

Daivik Patel is a 20-year-old undergraduate at Rutgers Honors College (Math + CS dual degree) who has co-authored 5 papers in ~6 months (including one at NeurIPS 2025 workshop and papers under review at ICLR 2026, ICML 2026, and CVPR 2026), won 6 hackathons at top universities, built two consumer products with 300K+ combined users, and co-founded **Param** (withparam.com) -- a startup building AI voice agents to automate dental office-insurance company communications. He received a $25K Telora Fellowship for Param (~1% acceptance rate). He is **already building a company** and commercializing his AI expertise, though Param is focused on healthcare admin rather than directly on the ENGRAM memory system.

- **Website:** [withparam.com](https://www.withparam.com)
- **LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/company/withparam](https://www.linkedin.com/company/withparam)
- **Founded:** 2024
- **Size:** 2-10 employees
- **Industry:** Healthcare / AI
- **What it does:** AI voice agent that calls insurance companies on behalf of dental offices, handles conversations with insurance agents, and retrieves patient/claims details. Addresses the pain point that typical dental offices spend 10-15 hours/week on the phone with insurance companies.
- **Co-Founders:**
  - **Daivik Patel** -- Co-Founder
  - **Shrenik Patel** -- Co-Founder (listed on LinkedIn as Co-Founder of Param)
  - **Ashrith Athmaram** -- Co-Founder (also Rutgers student; LinkedIn shows "Co-Founder - Venefit" which appears to be a prior/alternate name; listed as Fellow at Telora on SignalHire)
- **Funding:** $25,000 Telora Fellowship (pre-seed grant, ~1% acceptance rate)
- **Note:** Ashrith's LinkedIn title says "Co-Founder - Venefit" with description "Helping dentists verify their patients' insurance" -- Venefit may be a prior name or DBA for Param.

## Shrenik Patel -- Co-Author & Co-Founder

### Profile

- **Education:** Math + CS @ Rutgers Honors College (undergraduate, same as Daivik)
- **LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/in/shrenik-patel-783151247](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrenik-patel-783151247)
- **Title:** Co-Founder of Param
- **Bio:** "AI Researcher | Builder | Math & CS @Rutgers Honors. My interest and passion lies in responsible tech with a focus on ML/AI."
- **GitHub:** [github.com/shrenikpatel17](https://huggingface.co/shrenikpatel17) (HuggingFace handle, part of Humun team); possibly [github.com/shrenik](https://github.com/shrenik) (2 repos) or [github.com/shrenikp](https://github.com/shrenikp) (4 repos)
- **Semantic Scholar:** [Profile](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Shrenik-Patel/2334704037)

### Research

Co-authored all 5 papers with Daivik (ENGRAM, CacheFlow, DoubleTake, Reuse Don't Recompute, Cooperative AI). Both are listed as equal contributors on ENGRAM.

### Other Projects

- **CodeBench** development team member (with Daivik, under Dr. Gunawardena)
- **Bloom** hackathon project (HackPrinceton Fall 2023, 1st place education track) -- team member with Daivik and Ashrith
- **Humun / Humanity Unleashed** -- listed as team member on HuggingFace org

### Note on Name Disambiguation

There are multiple "Shrenik Patel" profiles online. The co-author is the Rutgers undergrad (linkedin.com/in/shrenik-patel-783151247), NOT the Qualcomm Senior Director, nor the MoneyJar/Crunchbase fintech co-founder, nor the JPMorgan VP.

## Commercialization Assessment

### Is he starting a company around ENGRAM?

**Not directly, but the pattern is strongly suggestive of a future AI infra play.**

Evidence FOR commercialization (of some kind):
1. **Already has a startup (Param)** -- proves he's a builder, not just a researcher. Has gone through fellowship process, has co-founders, has a product.
2. **"DRVN Intelligence"** -- his older GitHub bio says "DRVN Intelligence." This could be a dormant project name or personal brand.
3. **Research velocity is extraordinary** -- 5 papers in ~6 months, spanning memory systems (ENGRAM, ENGRAM-R, CacheFlow), medical AI (DoubleTake), and AI policy. This is founder-level output.
4. **SF presence** -- lists San Francisco as secondary location alongside NJ. SF presence for an East Coast undergrad signals startup intent.
5. **Consumer product track record** -- 270K+ and 32K+ users shows he can ship and grow products, not just publish papers.
6. **Hackathon dominance** -- 6 first-place finishes at Princeton, Yale, Brown, CMU, Rutgers shows consistent execution under pressure.

Evidence AGAINST near-term ENGRAM commercialization:
1. **Param is in a different domain** (dental insurance voice agents, not memory infrastructure). His current startup energy is directed elsewhere.
2. **No public ENGRAM code repository** -- paper has no linked GitHub repo. If commercializing, might be keeping code private intentionally, or it's just academic work.
3. **Still an undergraduate** -- likely has 1-2 years left at Rutgers.
4. **ENGRAM paper is under ICLR review** -- may be waiting for acceptance before deciding next steps.

**Assessment:** Daivik is a builder-researcher hybrid. He's already founding companies (Param) but his deepest research expertise is in memory systems for AI agents. If Param doesn't scale, or if ENGRAM gets strong reception at ICLR 2026, there's a meaningful probability he pivots to or starts a second venture in AI memory infrastructure. The "DRVN Intelligence" GitHub bio is a breadcrumb worth watching.

## Risks & Open Questions

1. **Param's traction is unknown** -- no public metrics on revenue, customers, or usage. withparam.com was unreachable during this research.
2. **Competitive landscape for dental AI is crowded** -- Arini (YC), Toothy AI (YC), Stratus, DentalRobot, and many voice agent platforms are attacking the same problem.
3. **Undergraduate status** -- how does he balance a full course load, 5 active papers, and a startup? Is he taking time off?
4. **Advisor relationship unclear** -- Dr. Gunawardena is a teaching professor focused on CS education (CodeBench), not a traditional research advisor in ML/AI. Who is supervising the ML research?
5. **No disclosed funding beyond Telora** -- $25K is minimal. Is Param seeking a seed round?
6. **Relationship between Param and Venefit unclear** -- Ashrith's LinkedIn says "Venefit" while other sources say "Param." Could be a rebrand.
