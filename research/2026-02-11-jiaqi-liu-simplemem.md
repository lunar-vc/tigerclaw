# Jiaqi Liu -- SimpleMem / AIMING Lab

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Analyst:** Claude (Tigerclaw)
**Type:** Founder Research

## Executive Summary

Jiaqi Liu is a first-year CS PhD student at UNC-Chapel Hill working under Professors Mingyu Ding and Huaxiu Yao in the AIMING Lab. He is the lead author on SimpleMem (arxiv 2601.02553), an efficient lifelong memory framework for LLM agents that has gained significant traction (2,767 GitHub stars, 280 forks, PyPI package, hosted MCP cloud service). There are early but concrete signs of commercialization: a registered domain (simplemem.com) under "Simplemem Inc." with Stripe billing, a hosted cloud MCP service (mcp.simplemem.cloud), and a separate side project (Skillbolt/TacoSkill) with connections to the AIMING lab. Liu is exceptionally productive for an early-stage PhD student and shows a builder pattern beyond pure academic output.

**Master's work at Tongji:** Focused on autonomous driving, decision-making, social interaction, and reinforcement learning. Had an earlier academic homepage at jiaqiliu-aca.netlify.app.

**Inference:** Extremely productive. Range spans from autonomous driving (Tongji) through VLMs and agents (Berkeley/UNC). The pivot to agent infrastructure (SimpleMem, SkillRL) is the most commercially relevant thread.

### 8. Signs of Commercialization / Startup Formation

**STRONG SIGNALS:**

1. **simplemem.com** -- A registered domain with a commercial landing page. Copyright "Simplemem Inc. 2025." Has Stripe billing integration with a tiered pricing model (Free: 20 memories, Pro: 100 memories). Support email: support@simplemem.com. This is a registered company. (Source: https://simplemem.com/)

2. **mcp.simplemem.cloud** -- A hosted cloud MCP service. Users register with OpenRouter API keys and receive access tokens. This is infrastructure-as-a-service, not just an academic demo. (Source: https://mcp.simplemem.cloud/)

3. **PyPI package** -- `pip install simplemem` was published on 2026-01-20. This is distribution-ready software, not a research prototype. (Source: GitHub README timeline)

4. **SimpleMem-MCP** -- Jiaqi Liu has a personal repo (github.com/Jiaaqiliu/SimpleMem-MCP) that is a standalone MCP server for SimpleMem in JavaScript, separate from the lab's main repo. This suggests independent productization work.

5. **Skillbolt / TacoSkill** -- Jiaqi Liu has Skillbolt pinned on his GitHub profile. TacoSkill (github.com/TacoSkill) describes itself as "The full-lifecycle AI skills platform powering the next generation of AI companies." The sole contributor is GRAPE-VLA, an account connected to the AIMING lab (GRAPE is an AIMING lab project). This appears to be a side venture linked to the lab's agent skills work. (Source: https://github.com/TacoSkill/Skillbolt)

6. **Cross-session memory development** -- The repo SimpleMem_Cross on Jiaqi Liu's personal GitHub suggests he is developing cross-session persistent memory capabilities, a key product differentiator.

7. **Discord and WeChat communities** -- SimpleMem has community channels, unusual for a pure academic project.

**MODERATE SIGNALS:**

8. **Huaxiu Yao's Twitter promotion** of SimpleMem MCP as a "LIVE" cloud service -- PIs don't typically promote cloud services unless there's a productization intent. (Source: https://x.com/HuaxiuYaoML/status/2011285177985622378)

9. **MIT License** -- All code is MIT-licensed, enabling commercial use.

10. **Antibody-database** -- A JavaScript repo on Jiaqi Liu's GitHub, recently updated (2026-02-10), with no description. Could be a biotech side project or consulting work.

## Risks & Open Questions

1. **PhD student timing:** Liu just started his PhD (Aug 2025). Leaving to start a company this early would be unusual, though not unheard of. The question is whether "Simplemem Inc." is a serious venture or a side-project LLC for hosting costs.
2. **IP ownership:** SimpleMem was developed in the AIMING Lab at UNC. University IP policies could complicate commercialization. Need to understand UNC's stance on student-created IP.
3. **Relationship to Mem0:** Mem0 (formerly MemGPT) is the best-funded competitor in the agent memory space. SimpleMem benchmarks directly against it and claims significant improvements. This validates the market but also means competition.
4. **Who is "InfiniteLoopCoder"?** The second-largest contributor (13 commits) is unidentified. Could be another lab member, a hired developer, or an external contributor.
5. **TacoSkill/Skillbolt connection:** The Skillbolt project's sole contributor (GRAPE-VLA) maps to the AIMING lab's GRAPE project. If this is a stealth startup vehicle, the lab may be incubating multiple ventures.
6. **Advisor involvement:** Huaxiu Yao is directly contributing code to SimpleMem (5 commits) and promoting the cloud service. His level of involvement in any commercial entity matters -- is this a lab project with a commercial wrapper, or is the PI co-founding?
7. **simplemem.com vs mcp.simplemem.cloud:** These appear to be separate services. The .com site is explicitly "Simplemem Inc." with pricing. The .cloud site is presented more as a lab demo. The relationship between them needs clarification.
8. **Chinese name variation:** Google Scholar shows the name as "刘佳琦" (Liu Jiaqi), confirming he is Chinese-origin. There may be additional Chinese-language publications or projects.

## Assessment

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Signal strength** | Strong | Multiple converging indicators: commercial entity, cloud service, PyPI package, high GitHub traction, active development |
| **Thesis fit** | Direct | Agent memory infrastructure is a core AI infra primitive |
| **Builder pattern** | Strong | 16 repos, lead author on multiple papers, MCP server, cloud service, PyPI package -- all in 6 months since starting PhD |
| **Founder-market fit** | Strong | Deep technical expertise in agent systems, RL, embodied AI; direct experience building the core technology |
| **Timing** | Early | First-year PhD student; "Simplemem Inc." may be nascent; no public funding announcements |
| **Market validation** | Strong | 2,767 stars in 6 weeks; SimpleMem benchmarks favorably vs Mem0 (funded competitor); MCP ecosystem integration |

**Action:** WATCH -- monitor for signs of leaving PhD program, raising funding, or expanding "Simplemem Inc." beyond a side project. The commercial entity already exists. The question is whether it stays a hobby or becomes a venture.

**Next steps:**
- Track simplemem.com for pricing changes or team page additions
- Monitor Jiaqi Liu's GitHub for new repos outside the aiming-lab org
- Watch Huaxiu Yao's Twitter for further product announcements
- Check if "Simplemem Inc." appears in any state incorporation records
- Monitor for Mem0-adjacent hiring signals or Y Combinator applications
