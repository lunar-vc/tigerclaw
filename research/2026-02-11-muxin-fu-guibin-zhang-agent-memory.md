**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Analyst:** Claude (Tigerclaw)
**Type:** Founder Research

## Executive Summary

Muxin Fu and Guibin Zhang are prolific co-authors who have published three major papers on agent memory systems (G-Memory, MemGen, LatentMem) in a span of eight months (June 2025 -- February 2026). Guibin Zhang is a first-year PhD student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) under Prof. Shuicheng Yan (co-CEO of Skywork AI, Fellow of AAAI/ACM/IEEE). Muxin Fu is an undergraduate student at Tongji University in Shanghai. Together they have landed a NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight and an ICLR 2026 acceptance -- an extraordinary output for researchers at their career stage. No signs of commercialization have been detected yet; both appear to be in pure research mode.

## 7. Assessment

### Signal Strength: Strong

**Converging indicators:**
1. **Extraordinary publication velocity** -- 3 major agent memory papers in 8 months as co-first authors
2. **Top venue acceptances** -- NeurIPS Spotlight + ICLR acceptance (Guibin Zhang has 4 ICLR 2025 papers, 3 ICML 2025 papers including an Oral, 3 ACL 2025 papers, 1 NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight, CVPR 2025, AAAI 2025)
3. **Muxin Fu is an undergraduate** landing NeurIPS Spotlight and ICLR papers -- extremely rare, indicates exceptional talent
4. **Advisor is Shuicheng Yan** -- one of the most connected AI researchers in Asia with direct commercial ties (Skywork AI)
5. **Research area is agent memory** -- one of the hottest infrastructure problems in AI agents right now
6. **Active code releases** -- MemGen has 304 GitHub stars, GMemory 193 stars; open-source model on HuggingFace
7. **Both researchers are very early career** -- PhD year 1 (Zhang) and undergraduate (Fu)

### Thesis Fit: Direct
- Agent memory is a core AI infrastructure primitive. Their work on latent memory representations, hierarchical memory systems, and memory policy optimization maps directly to commercial memory infrastructure for LLM agents.

### Risks & Open Questions
1. **No commercialization signals yet** -- Both are in pure academic mode. Zhang is "open to collaboration and internship." No company, no patent filings detected.
2. **Muxin Fu's next step is unknown** -- As an undergraduate, will they pursue a PhD (and where)? Or enter industry?
3. **Guibin Zhang just started his PhD** -- He's in Year 1 (Fall 2025 start). Academic commitment may delay any founding activity by 3-5 years.
4. **Shuicheng Yan / Skywork AI relationship** -- Research could be absorbed into Skywork AI's commercial work rather than spawning an independent startup.
5. **LinkedIn and Twitter presence is nil** -- Both researchers are invisible on professional social networks, making it harder to track their movements.
6. **Muxin Fu's identity is opaque** -- No personal website, no LinkedIn, no Twitter. Only identifiable through OpenReview (Tongji undergrad) and GitHub (KANABOON1).

### Action: WATCH
- Both are too early in their careers for immediate outreach, but their research output is exceptional and the agent memory space is commercially hot. **Monitor for:**
  - Muxin Fu's post-graduation plans (PhD program or industry move)
  - Any Skywork AI involvement or commercialization of this research line
  - New papers or repos from either researcher
  - GitHub activity on KANABOON1 and bingreeky accounts
  - Any LinkedIn/Twitter accounts appearing
