# Varad Kulkarni -- FAME / MCP-FaaS / StrideBase

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Analyst:** Claude (Tigerclaw)
**Type:** Founder Research

## Executive Summary

Varad Kulkarni is a PhD candidate at IISc Bangalore's DREAM:Lab (Department of Computational and Data Sciences), advised by Prof. Yogesh Simmhan. He is the first author of the FAME paper (arxiv 2601.14735, Jan 2026), which presents a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows with up to 13x latency reduction and 66% cost savings. His LinkedIn currently lists him at **StrideBase** with the tagline "AI, Space & Defence." Weekday.works describes his StrideBase role as "Founder's Office" (Aug 2024 -- Jun 2025), where he "Built AI-Powered Geo-spatial Systems for smarter GTM." He also co-founded **Clarevel**, an AI interviewer hiring platform (Jul 2022 -- Jul 2023). He has a prior startup attempt plus strong systems engineering background (PhonePe, Kawa Space, competitive programming). The StrideBase entity has near-zero public footprint -- no website, no funding record, no company LinkedIn page found. It may be a stealth/early-stage venture or a consulting vehicle connected to his work at Kawa Space.

## 1. Background & Education

- **Undergrad:** B.E. in Electrical, Electronics, and Communications Engineering, Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT), Pune. (Source: [Weekday.works](https://www.weekday.works/people/varad-kulkarni-varadkulkarni11))
- **PhD (ongoing, 2021--present):** Computational Data Science, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. DREAM:Lab, advised by Prof. Yogesh Simmhan. Expected completion ~2026.

- Left job at PhonePe in Sep 2020 to prepare for GATE 2021, joined IISc PhD program in 2021

## 2. StrideBase

**What we know:**
- Varad's LinkedIn headline: "StrideBase" with tagline "AI, Space & Defence" (Source: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varadkulkarni11/))
- Weekday.works listing: Role = "Founder's Office" at StrideBase, Aug 2024 -- Jun 2025. Description: "Built AI-Powered Geo-spatial Systems for smarter GTM" (Source: [Weekday.works](https://www.weekday.works/people/varad-kulkarni-varadkulkarni11))
- No company website found (stridebase.com, stridebase.io, stridebase.ai all return no results)
- No LinkedIn company page found for "StrideBase"
- No Crunchbase, Tracxn, or other funding database entries found
- No other employees or co-founders identified

**Assessment:**
- "Founder's Office" is a common Indian startup term meaning he was working closely with founders or was a founding team member. It does not necessarily mean he was THE founder.
- The dates (Aug 2024 -- Jun 2025) overlap with his work at Kawa Space (Jun 2024 -- May 2025). StrideBase may be related to or spun out of Kawa Space, or it may be a separate venture he was involved with concurrently.
- The "AI-Powered Geo-spatial Systems for smarter GTM" description aligns with Kawa Space's domain (satellite-based geospatial intelligence for national security). StrideBase could be a product, project, or consulting entity within that ecosystem.
- **SPECULATION:** StrideBase is likely either (a) an early-stage stealth venture in AI+geospatial for defence that has not yet publicly launched, (b) a consulting/contracting vehicle Varad used while at Kawa Space, or (c) a pivoted/dormant project.

## 3. Prior Venture: Clarevel

- **Role:** Co-Founder (Source: [Weekday.works](https://www.weekday.works/people/varad-kulkarni-varadkulkarni11))
- **Duration:** Jul 2022 -- Jul 2023 (1 year)
- **Description:** "End-to-end hiring platform with AI Interviewers"
- No web presence found for Clarevel. Appears to be shut down or pivoted.
- Shows entrepreneurial intent -- this was his first known startup attempt, done while in PhD.

## 12. Signs of Commercialization

| Signal | Strength | Evidence |
|--------|----------|----------|
| LinkedIn shows "StrideBase" (AI, Space & Defence) | Medium | Current LinkedIn headline. But no company website, funding, or other employees found. |
| Prior co-founded Clarevel (AI hiring) | Medium | Shows entrepreneurial intent. Company appears defunct after 1 year. |
| "Founder's Office" role at StrideBase | Medium | Suggests founding team involvement. But "Founder's Office" in India can also mean working for someone else's company. |
| Overlap with Kawa Space work | Medium | StrideBase and Kawa Space periods overlap. Both in geospatial+defence. May be related entities. |
| FAME paper has strong applied focus | Medium | Paper targets real-world cost/latency optimization for agentic AI on cloud. Highly productizable. |
| IBM Research collaboration | Weak-Medium | Joint papers with IBM Research Bangalore suggest industry connections but not direct commercialization of FAME. |
| No FAME-related company formation signals | Weak | No startup around MCP/FaaS infrastructure has been announced. His commercial focus appears to be geospatial/defence, not agentic infra. |

## 13. FAME Paper Technical Assessment

The FAME paper is interesting from an infra perspective:
- **Problem:** MCP-enabled agentic workflows are expensive and slow on traditional VMs; FaaS offers cost savings but is stateless
- **Solution:** Decompose agentic patterns (ReAct) into Planner/Actor/Evaluator FaaS functions orchestrated via AWS Step Functions, with DynamoDB for state persistence and S3 for MCP caching
- **Results:** 13x latency reduction, 88% fewer input tokens, 66% cost savings
- **Tech stack:** LangGraph, AWS Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB, FastMCP
- **Productization potential:** High. This addresses a real pain point for anyone deploying MCP-based agents at scale. Could be an open-source framework, a managed service, or integrated into existing FaaS platforms.
- **Competition:** Anthropic's own MCP infrastructure, LangSmith/LangGraph Cloud, modal.com, various serverless AI platforms

## Risks & Open Questions

1. **Is StrideBase a real company or a label?** No company registration, website, or funding records found. Could be a personal brand or early-stage stealth project.
2. **Is Varad commercializing FAME or is it purely academic?** The paper's IBM Research co-authors suggest this may stay in the academic/IBM sphere rather than becoming a startup.
3. **PhD completion timeline?** Expected ~2026. Is he wrapping up or extending? This affects commercial availability.
4. **What happened to Clarevel?** No trace of the AI hiring platform. Understanding why it failed would inform assessment of his entrepreneurial capability.
5. **Relationship between StrideBase and Kawa Space?** Overlapping timelines and domains suggest possible spin-out or consulting arrangement.
6. **Is the "Founder's Office" role at StrideBase still active?** Weekday.works shows it ended Jun 2025, but LinkedIn still shows StrideBase as current.

## Thesis Fit

- **Domain:** AI infrastructure / agentic systems / serverless -- DIRECT fit to thesis
- **Secondary domain:** AI + geospatial + defence (via StrideBase/Kawa Space) -- ADJACENT
- **Primitive:** FaaS-based state management and orchestration for MCP agents
- **Signal strength:** MEDIUM
  - Strong academic output in a hot area (MCP infrastructure)
  - Demonstrated entrepreneurial intent (Clarevel co-founder, StrideBase)
  - BUT: no clear signal he's building a company around FAME specifically
  - The geospatial/defence focus (StrideBase) is his commercial lane, not agentic infra
  - PhD candidate -- may not be in a position to found right now

## Action: WATCH

- Monitor for: (a) StrideBase becoming a real entity with a website/funding, (b) FAME being open-sourced or productized, (c) PhD completion announcement, (d) new GitHub repos related to MCP/FaaS orchestration
- Do not reach out yet -- signal is not strong enough for cold outreach. The commercial intent is unclear and may be in geospatial/defence rather than agentic infra.
