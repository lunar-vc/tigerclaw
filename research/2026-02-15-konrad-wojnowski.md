# Konrad Wojnowski / Probabilistic Minds Consortium — Founder Research

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Analyst:** Claude (Tigerclaw)
**Type:** Founder Research
**HN Username:** kwojno
**Signal Strength:** Medium (Academic founder building in stealth while battling cancer)

## Executive Summary

Konrad Wojnowski is a Polish academic and theorist who has pivoted from performativity studies to building a fundamentally new approach to AI mathematics. While battling a rare form of cancer from a hospital bed, he developed a CPU-based neural network using integer ratios instead of floating-point arithmetic, with formal Coq proofs. The project ("VOID Theory" / "Finite Capacity Based System") rejects mathematical infinity and builds AI systems that explicitly say "I don't know" when uncertain. Open-source (MIT), no commercial intent stated, but represents a genuine technical innovation with philosophical depth.

**Key Finding:** This is a rare academic-founder hybrid — deep domain expertise (probability theory, avant-garde aesthetics, performativity), technical execution (Coq proofs + Rust implementation), personal urgency (terminal illness), and philosophical coherence. Not actively seeking to start a company, but the work is groundbreaking enough to warrant monitoring.

## Personal Background

**Name:** Dr. Konrad Wojnowski
**Born:** 1987 (age ~38-39)
**Location:** Kraków, Poland
**Affiliation:** Assistant Professor, Performativity Studies Department, Jagiellonian University
**Education:** PhD in Philosophy (Jagiellonian University); studied at Freie Universität Berlin

**Health Status:**
Currently fighting a rare form of cancer (fewer than 20 documented cases as of 3 years ago). Has been hospitalized extensively. In May 2024 interview, mentioned an upcoming major surgical procedure. As of February 2026, reports "cancer is receding" while continuing development work from hospital bed.

- *Useful Disasters* (Universitas, 2016, Polish) — performative power of catastrophes in network culture
- *The Aesthetics of Disturbance* (Księgarnia Akademicka, 2012, Polish) — study of Michael Haneke's cinema
- 42 research papers on Academia.edu
- Google Scholar profile (low citation count, niche field)

**Awards:**
- Foundation for Polish Science prize for outstanding young scholars
- Led two research projects funded by Poland's National Science Centre

**Collaborations:**
- **UKRAiNATV** — experimental web streaming collective mixing live performance, randomness, and philosophy (Kraków-Amsterdam-Kyiv collaboration)
- Self-described as working with AI systems (Claude, ChatGPT) as "co-authors—not tools"

## The VOID Theory / Finite Capacity System

**GitHub Organization:** probabilistic-minds-consortium
**Key Repository:** void-mathematics-fully-finite-coq-verified
**Created:** Late 2024 / early 2025
**License:** MIT (fully open-source)

### Core Innovation

Rejects mathematical infinity as foundational assumption. Builds a formal system where:
- **Probability restricted to open interval (0,1)** — certainty (0 or 1) is mathematically inexpressible at the type level
- **Finite types (Fin)** replace Peano natural numbers — no infinite successor axiom
- **Budget Monad** tracks computational cost — every operation costs finite, irreversible energy (thermodynamic constraint)
- **Bool3 logic** — True, False, Unknown (when resources exhaust before conclusion)

### Implementation

1. **Formal Proofs (Coq/Rocq):** 41 verified files defining the mathematical framework
2. **VOID Neural Network (Rust):** 500 lines, pattern-matching via integer ratios (5/8 instead of 0.625), cross-multiplication for comparison
3. **Parasitic Monitor (Python v3.1):** Attaches to existing LLMs without modifying weights — monitors outputs and flags hallucinations structurally

**Test Results (Medical Diagnosis Task):**
- 50% correct diagnosis
- 20% related-but-incorrect (flagged as such)
- 30% "I don't know" (honest uncertainty)
- **0 hallucinations** (per author's claim)

**Key Quote (HN):**
"written with ai during my long stay in hospital bed with cancer. cancer is receding, code is compiling, and the network is learning."

### Philosophical Underpinning

Wojnowski frames this as a critique of the "Matrix paradigm" — the assumption that reality is fundamentally computational and infinite. Instead:
- Reality is finite, observation costs energy
- Certainty is impossible (structural, not training-based)
- AI should admit ignorance when it doesn't know

From interview: "The lack of [statistical] data renders my prognosis incalculable, which I find strangely liberating. It also left me room to eventually shape my personal narrative about the illness."

This personal confrontation with radical uncertainty (unknowable cancer prognosis) directly informs the mathematical framework.

### Academic Endorsements

- **Thierry Coquand** (University of Gothenburg, creator of Calculus of Constructions) — verified mathematical formalism
- **Doron Zeilberger** (Rutgers University) — noted this as "an actual implementation of finitary math"

## Founder Potential Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Deep domain expertise** — 15+ years studying probability in art/philosophy, now applied to AI
2. **Technical execution** — Coq proofs + working Rust implementation (not just theory)
3. **Philosophical coherence** — life experience (cancer uncertainty) informs technical design
4. **Academic credibility** — published by Edinburgh University Press, endorsed by top researchers
5. **Urgency** — health crisis creates personal drive and time pressure
6. **Open-source ethos** — MIT license, public code, collaborative mindset

### Weaknesses
1. **No commercial intent** — explicitly rejects profit motive, values intellectual freedom
2. **Solo operator** — no co-founder, minimal team (if any)
3. **Academic trajectory** — tenured professor, not entrepreneurial background
4. **Health risk** — ongoing cancer treatment, surgical procedures, uncertain prognosis
5. **Geographic constraint** — Kraków (not a major AI hub), limited startup ecosystem
6. **Minimal social presence** — almost no Twitter, LinkedIn, or online visibility outside academia

### Inflection Indicators
- Recent HN post (Feb 2026) shows willingness to share work publicly
- Shift from pure theory (books, papers) to shipping code (GitHub, working implementation)
- Endorsements from heavyweight academics (Coquand, Zeilberger) signal credibility
- Cancer "receding" per latest HN comment — if health improves, bandwidth increases

### Likelihood of Starting a Company
**Low (10-20%)** in the short term. Wojnowski's self-description and public statements emphasize:
- Freedom from profit constraints
- Collaborative, open-source dissemination
- Critique of institutional/commercial frameworks
- Academic positioning over entrepreneurship

However, if:
- Health stabilizes
- Technology gains traction (HN attention, academic adoption)
- Right co-founder or technical collaborator emerges
- Funding offered with minimal strings attached (e.g., ARIA-style grant, not VC)

...there is a non-zero chance he could transition to founding a research lab or nonprofit entity. Not a traditional VC-backed startup.

## Thesis Fit

**Domain:** AI infrastructure (specifically: alternative mathematical foundations for neural networks)

**Primitive:** Finite arithmetic, thermodynamic computation, structural uncertainty

**Fit:** **Adjacent**

This is not directly applicable to mainstream AI infrastructure (requires rewriting everything from scratch), but it could unlock:
- **Explainable AI** — integer ratios are human-readable, no black-box floating-point
- **Low-power AI** — CPU-based, no GPU required, finite resource constraints
- **Safety-critical AI** — medical, aerospace, finance (where "I don't know" is more valuable than hallucinated confidence)
- **Edge AI** — embedded systems, IoT, resource-constrained environments

If VOID Theory proves correct, it's a paradigm shift comparable to moving from alchemy to chemistry. If wrong, it's an elegant intellectual exercise with limited practical impact.

## Risks & Open Questions

**Risks:**
1. **Health trajectory** — cancer prognosis unknown, treatment ongoing
2. **Commercial viability** — MIT license + anti-profit stance = hard to monetize
3. **Adoption barrier** — requires abandoning standard ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
4. **Performance** — 50% accuracy on medical diagnosis is proof-of-concept, not production-ready
5. **Solo development** — no team, no co-founder, limited bandwidth

**Open Questions:**
1. What is the current health status? (Latest update: "cancer is receding" as of Feb 2026)
2. Is there a team, or is this a solo project? (GitHub org suggests solo)
3. Has anyone else replicated the results? (No independent verification found)
4. Are there any patents, or is everything open-source? (All MIT license, no patents found)
5. What is the path from 50% accuracy to production-level performance?
6. Is there interest from any labs, researchers, or companies? (Academic endorsements yes, commercial interest unknown)
7. Would he consider a research lab or nonprofit structure? (Possible, but not stated)

## Action

**WATCH** — Monitor for:
1. Health updates (recovery would increase bandwidth)
2. GitHub activity (new releases, contributors joining)
3. Academic adoption (citations, forks, independent implementations)
4. HN/social engagement (increased visibility, community interest)
5. Any mention of co-founders, collaborators, or organizational structure
6. Grants or funding (ARIA, NSF, ERC) that might enable full-time research

**Why not REACH_OUT now:**
- No stated commercial or startup intent
- Health situation creates uncertainty
- Anti-profit philosophy may make VC pitch counterproductive
- Better to wait for signal of readiness (co-founder search, grant application, increased public engagement)

**If any of these occur, revisit immediately:**
- Announces co-founder or team formation
- Applies for non-dilutive grant (ARIA, NSF, ERC)
- Posts "looking for collaborators" or similar
- Performance metrics improve significantly (>70% accuracy)
- Major lab or company expresses interest publicly
- Health stabilizes and public activity increases

**Next Steps:**
1. Set HN alert for "kwojno" posts/comments
2. Star GitHub repo to track activity
3. Check blog quarterly for updates
4. Monitor Google Scholar for new citations
5. Revisit in Q2 2026 if health status improves
