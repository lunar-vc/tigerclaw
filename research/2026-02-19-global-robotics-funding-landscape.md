## Executive Summary

Robotics venture funding has entered an unprecedented boom cycle. After a trough in 2023, the sector has ripped upward at a pace that exceeds even the 2021 ZIRP peak. The numbers tell the story:

- **2023:** ~$5.1B (PitchBook) / $10.6B (F-Prime, broader definition) -- trough year, down from $18.5B in 2022
- **2024:** $6.1B (PitchBook) / $8.2B (Crunchbase) -- recovery begins, +19% YoY
- **2025:** ~$14B (Crunchbase) / $21B (F-Prime, incl. defense/M&A) -- all-time record, +70% YoY
- **2026 YTD:** Momentum continuing; Apptronik ($520M), Skild AI ($1.4B), RobCo ($100M), Zipline ($600M) all closed in Jan-Feb 2026

The boom is driven by three converging forces: (1) foundation models making general-purpose robots plausible for the first time, (2) massive defense spending in both the US and Europe, and (3) a labor shortage narrative that finally has hardware deployment to back it up. Humanoid robots alone attracted ~$4.6B in 2025.

**For Lunar at pre-seed:** The opportunity is real but requires discipline. The mega-rounds ($500M+) are concentrating in US-based humanoid plays and foundation model companies. Europe's robotics funding hit ~EUR 1.1B across 104 deals in 2025 (PitchBook), with a healthy early-stage pipeline. The white space for a EUR 1-2M pre-seed fund is in the enabling layers -- robot learning infrastructure, sim-to-real pipelines, domain-specific manipulation, and defense robotics -- rather than in competing directly with billion-dollar humanoid plays.

## 1. Total Robotics Funding by Year

### Year-over-Year Comparison

| Year | Crunchbase | PitchBook | F-Prime (Broad) | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| 2020 | -- | -- | -- | Pre-boom |
| 2021 | $13.1B | -- | -- | Peak of ZIRP-era funding |
| 2022 | -- | $18.5B | -- | Still elevated |
| 2023 | -- | $5.1B | $10.6B | Trough. VC winter hits robotics hard |
| 2024 | $8.2B | $6.1B | -- | Recovery. AI narrative reignites interest |
| 2025 | ~$14B | -- | $21B | All-time record (Crunchbase: +70% YoY) |
| H1 2025 | $6B+ | -- | -- | Already matched 2024 full-year pace by July |
| Q1 2025 | $2.26B | -- | -- | Strong start |

**Source discrepancies:** F-Prime uses a broader definition of "robotics" that includes defense acquisitions (e.g., BlueHalo's $4.1B deal), drone companies, and adjacent automation. Crunchbase focuses on startups developing robotics technologies. PitchBook's 2024 figure of $6.1B is VC-only and excludes grants/debt.

**Key data points:**
- Crunchbase: "Startups in the sector raised nearly $14 billion in funding in 2025, up from $8.2 billion in 2024, even topping the $13.1 billion raised in the peak venture funding year of 2021." ([Source](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/ai-humanoid-robot-funding-apptronik/))
- F-Prime: "Investment in robotics is projected to reach an all-time high of $21 billion this year" ([Source](https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2025/11/07/f-primes-state-of-robotics-2025-report-shows-record-21-billion-investment-but-is-it-another-bubble/96377/))
- PitchBook: "Investors poured $6.1 billion of VC dollars into robotics [in 2024], up 19% from 2023" ([Source](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/ai-fuels-vc-interest-robotics-funding-grows-2024))

### Stage Breakdown (2025)

- **General-purpose robotics (humanoids + AI-driven):** $5B in 2025, up 150% from $2B in 2024 (F-Prime)
- **Defense robotics:** 63% of the $21B F-Prime total -- dominated by BlueHalo ($4.1B acquisition) and drone/autonomous systems
- **Early-stage (<$50M rounds):** Near all-time highs; Hard2beat VC estimates sub-$50M early-stage could top $4.5B in 2025
- **Corporate VC:** Surged 183% YoY in Q1 2024, reaching $1.3B across 34 deals ([Source](https://www.humanoidsdaily.com/news/corporate-investors-bet-big-on-robotics-revolution-cvc-deals-jump-183-in-q1))

### Share of Total VC

Robotics' share of overall VC has roughly tripled: from ~1.6% to ~4.3% of total venture funding, with 2024 hitting 5.58% -- a ~2.64x YoY increase vs. the overall market's 1.11x growth ([Source](https://hard2beat.vc/insights-resources/robotics-startups-2025-the-who-cares-sector-thats-suddenly-breaking-out/)).

## 3. European Robotics Funding

### Headline Numbers

- **2025 European robotics VC:** ~EUR 1.1B across 104 deals (PitchBook), up from EUR 761M across 104 deals in 2024
- At the same run rate, 2025 was on pace to surpass the 2021 peak of EUR 1.4B ([Source](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/european-vc-robotics-funding-gears-up-for-record-2025))
- Sifted reported EUR 1.1B invested across 104 deals by mid-year, already EUR 339M more than the prior year's total ([Source](https://sifted.eu/articles/europe-rides-the-robotics-wave-the-research-here-is-crazy))
- EU-Startups estimated ~EUR 65-70M of disclosed funding flowing specifically into European robotics/physical AI/warehouse automation in 2025 from their reported rounds alone ([Source](https://www.eu-startups.com/2026/01/polish-robotics-startup-nomagic-secures-e8-3-million-to-scale-physical-ai-operations-in-the-us))

### European Funding Gap

Europe accounts for roughly **8-10% of global robotics VC** despite having some of the strongest robotics research institutions globally (ETH Zurich, Imperial College, INRIA, TU Munich, KTH, etc.). The US dominated 2025's mega-rounds, and China had multiple $100M+ humanoid deals.

**The gap is most extreme at growth stage.** European companies that need $50M+ Series B/C rounds frequently need to tap US investors (Lightspeed, Khosla, a16z) or sovereign wealth (Temasek, Mubadala). At pre-seed/seed, Europe is more competitive.

### Notable European Robotics Rounds (2024-2026)

### European Pre-Seed/Seed Pipeline (FOV Ventures "10 to Watch in 2026")

FOV Ventures published a curated list of early-stage European robotics startups that directly maps Lunar's target profile ([Source](https://viewpoints.fov.ventures/p/10-early-stage-startups-to-watch-in-2026)):

1. **MAKIINA** (Finland) -- Modular HW/SW stack for physical AI; dual robotic arms for <$1,200
2. **Levtek** (Sweden) -- Software-defined ultralight EVs + cobots; partnered with PostNord
3. **Mimic** (Switzerland, ETH spinoff) -- AI-driven dexterous robotic hands; EUR 17M seed
4. **Paddington Robotics** (UK) -- Supermarket assist robots; founder previously sold Magic Pony to Twitter
5. **Loki Robotics** (Switzerland) -- Autonomous facility cleaning; end-to-end learning + teleoperation
6. **Qualia** (Denmark) -- Infrastructure for training/deploying VLA models (pi-0.5, SmolVLA, Gr00t)
7. **Saturn Dynamics** (UK) -- Physics-aware generative simulator for autonomous systems
8. **Voyage Robotics** (UK) -- Neural safety systems for physical AI; open-source robotics
9. **Kova Labs** (Finland) -- Embodied intelligence for defense/national security; backed by Lifeline Ventures
10. **Sunrise Robotics** (Slovenia) -- Autonomous robotic cells for manufacturing; $8.5M seed

**Lunar relevance:** Several of these (Qualia, Saturn Dynamics, Kova Labs, MAKIINA, Voyage Robotics) are either pre-seed or very early seed, and fall squarely into Lunar's thesis areas (robot data infrastructure, simulation, defense autonomy, and enabling infrastructure).

## 4. Category Breakdown: What's Getting Funded

### 4.1 Humanoid Robots

**The hottest category by far.** ~$4.6B invested in humanoid developers in 2025 alone ([Source](https://www.therobotreport.com/top-10-robotics-developments-of-january-2026/)). Over $9.8B cumulative since 2017 (Yole Group). More than 60 active humanoid companies globally, with China hosting >50%.

| Company | Total Raised | Valuation | HQ | Status |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----|--------|
| Figure AI | $1.9B+ | $39B | US | Apollo deployed at BMW; Helix AI platform |
| Apptronik | ~$935M | $5B+ | US (Austin) | Apollo robot; industrial deployments |
| Skild AI | $1.83B | $14B+ | US (Pittsburgh) | Software-first; "omni-bodied" brain |
| Physical Intelligence | $1.07B | $5.6B | US | Pi-zero foundation model |
| 1X Technologies | $100M+ (seeking $1B) | ~$10B (est.) | Norway/US | NEO home robot; OpenAI-backed; 2026 consumer launch |
| Neura Robotics | EUR 120M+ | EUR 8-10B (Tether talks) | Germany | 4NE1 humanoid; cognitive robotics |
| Unitree Robotics | Series C (>$1.4B val) | -- | China | Targeting 20,000 humanoid shipments in 2026 |
| Galbot | $300M+ | $3B | China | Manufacturing focus |
| Wandercraft | $75M | -- | France | Rehabilitation; Eve launching 2026 |
| Sanctuary AI | $140M+ | -- | Canada | Phoenix robot; cognitive architecture |
| Agility Robotics | $150M+ | -- | US | Digit robot; Amazon partnership |

**The bull case:** BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Amazon are deploying humanoids on production lines. Figure's valuation jumped 15x in 7 months ($2.6B to $39B) -- driven by deployment validation, not revenue.

**The bear case:** F-Prime warns that valuations reflect "speculative positioning" more than genuine commercial demand. Most humanoid companies have near-zero revenue. The $39B Figure valuation implies a market outcome that requires humanoids to become as ubiquitous as smartphones.

### 4.2 Robot Foundation Models / Embodied AI

The "brain" layer is attracting the most sophisticated investors. This is where the software-eats-hardware thesis meets robotics.

| Company | Amount | Approach | HQ |
|---------|--------|----------|-----|
| **Skild AI** | $1.83B total | "Omni-bodied" foundation model; any robot, any task | Pittsburgh |
| **Physical Intelligence** | $1.07B total | Pi-zero generalist policy; hardware-agnostic | San Francisco |
| **FieldAI** | $405M | Risk-aware foundation models; quadrupeds + humanoids + vehicles | Irvine, CA |
| **Genesis AI** | $105M seed | Universal robotics foundation model + full-stack platform | Paris / Palo Alto |
| **Flexion** | $57M | Reinforcement learning platform for humanoid autonomy (ex-NVIDIA) | Zurich |
| **Neuracore** | EUR 2.5M | Unified robot learning infrastructure | London |

**Key insight:** The economics of robotics are being fundamentally reshaped. Instead of every robot company building its own perception/control stack, foundation model companies aim to be the "Android of robots" -- a shared intelligence layer that runs on any hardware. This is the most VC-friendly part of the stack because it's software-first, scales with data flywheels, and has platform economics.

**VLA models (Vision-Language-Action)** are the specific architecture driving this: they combine visual perception, language understanding, and action generation in a single model. Google's RT-2, NVIDIA's Groot, Figure's Helix, and Physical Intelligence's pi-zero are the frontier. At ICLR 2026, there were 164 VLA-related submissions, signaling massive research momentum ([Source](https://mbreuss.github.io/blog_post_iclr_26_vla.html)).

### 4.3 Manipulation / Dexterity

| Company | Amount | Focus | HQ |
|---------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Dexterity** | $95M+ (Series C, $1.65B val) | Container loading/unloading | US |
| **Covariant** | Acquired by Amazon ($380M) | Robotic picking for fulfillment | US |
| **Mimic** | EUR 17M seed | Dexterous robotic hands (ETH spinoff) | Switzerland |
| **Nomagic** | $44M Series B + EUR 8.3M | Warehouse picking/sorting | Poland |
| **Sereact** | EUR 25M Series A | AI pick-and-place software | Germany |
| **CynLr** | Seeking $75M | Visual object intelligence for manipulation | India |

**Covariant's Amazon acqui-hire** is a critical signal: the most prominent standalone manipulation AI company was absorbed by the largest potential customer. This suggests that pure-play manipulation AI may struggle to remain independent -- the deployment environments (Amazon, DHL, etc.) want to own the stack.

### 4.4 Robot Data Infrastructure / Simulation

This is the "picks and shovels" opportunity -- and where Lunar should pay closest attention at pre-seed.

| Company | Amount | Focus | HQ |
|---------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Genesis AI** | $105M seed | Full-stack simulation + data engine + foundation model | Paris / Palo Alto |
| **Scale AI** (Physical AI division) | -- | Physical AI Data Engine; multimodal datasets for robots/AVs/drones | US |
| **NVIDIA Isaac** | Internal | GPU-accelerated simulation (Isaac Sim, Isaac Lab) | US |
| **Qualia** | Pre-seed | Infrastructure for deploying VLA models (pi-0.5, SmolVLA, Gr00t) | Denmark |
| **Saturn Dynamics** | Pre-seed | Physics-aware generative simulator | UK |
| **Neuracore** | EUR 2.5M pre-seed | Unified robot learning platform | UK |
| **CosmicBrain** | Early | Simulation models trained via wearable smart glasses | -- |
| **RealMan** | -- | Robotics data training center (108 robots, 3000 sq meters) | China |

**The data bottleneck is the #1 constraint in robotics AI.** IBM's reporting highlights that "the data gap is holding back robotics" -- language models train on internet-scale text, but there is no equivalent corpus of robot manipulation data. Companies solving this (synthetic data generation, teleoperation data collection, sim-to-real transfer) are building critical infrastructure.

NVIDIA's open Physical AI dataset and Apple's EgoDex (egocentric video with 3D hand tracking) are early attempts to create shared data assets. The equivalent of "ImageNet for robots" does not yet exist -- whoever builds it will have enormous leverage.

**Lunar angle:** This is the highest-conviction pre-seed thesis. European companies like Qualia (Denmark), Saturn Dynamics (UK), and Neuracore (UK) are at exactly the right stage for a EUR 1-2M check.

### 4.5 Teleoperation

| Company | Amount | Focus | HQ |
|---------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Mentee Robotics** | Acquired for $900M by Mobileye | Sim-based training; no teleoperation needed for deployment | Israel |
| **Loki Robotics** | Pre-seed | End-to-end learning + teleoperation for facility cleaning | Switzerland |
| **1X Technologies** | $100M+ | NEO robot uses teleoperation for data collection | Norway/US |

Teleoperation is evolving from a deployment mode (human-in-the-loop control) to a **data collection mechanism** (humans demonstrate tasks, data trains autonomous models). This "teleop-to-autonomy" pipeline is being used by Figure, 1X, and Physical Intelligence. The standalone teleoperation market is being subsumed by the broader robot learning stack.

### 4.6 Vertical / Industrial Robotics

| Company | Amount | Vertical | HQ |
|---------|--------|----------|-----|
| **RobCo** | $100M Series C | Manufacturing automation | Germany |
| **Dexory** | $165M | Warehouse inventory management | UK |
| **Sunrise Robotics** | $8.5M seed | Manufacturing robotic cells | Slovenia |
| **Nomagic** | $44M | Warehouse picking | Poland |
| **Infravision** | $91M Series B | Aerial power line stringing | US |
| **Upside Robotics** | $7.5M seed | Autonomous farming | Canada |
| **Rollo Robotics** | EUR 3.7M pre-seed | Autonomous security robot | Estonia |
| **Persona AI** | $27M pre-seed | Humanoid for shipbuilding | US |

Industrial/vertical robotics remains the most commercially proven category. Companies like RobCo (BMW deployments), Dexory (Eurazeo-backed warehouse), and Nomagic (DHL-scale logistics) have real customer deployments and revenue. The economics work because these are high-value, repetitive tasks with clear ROI.

### 4.7 Defense Robotics

Defense is the dark horse. Per F-Prime, defense robotics accounted for **63% of the $21B total** in 2025 -- dominated by the BlueHalo acquisition but also:
- **ARX Robotics** (Germany): EUR 31M Series A for autonomous unmanned ground systems
- **Kova Labs** (Finland): Pre-seed, embodied intelligence for defense/national security
- **Quantum Systems** (Germany): Unicorn-making drone round in May 2025
- **Tekever** (Portugal): $500M round, EUR 1B+ valuation for AI-powered recon drones

European defense is "booming" -- defense tech funding jumped nearly 30% in H1 2025, with Germany raking in EUR 805M alone. This is directly relevant to Lunar's defense/aerospace thesis.

## 5. The Current Wave: What's Happening RIGHT NOW

### 5.1 The Shift from Hardware-First to Software/Data-First

The defining characteristic of the 2024-2026 robotics wave is that the bottleneck has moved from hardware to software. Commodity hardware (Unitree's humanoid for ~$16K, off-the-shelf arms from FANUC/UR) means the value is now in:

1. **Foundation models** (Skild, Physical Intelligence, FieldAI) -- the "brain"
2. **Simulation + synthetic data** (Genesis AI, NVIDIA Isaac, Saturn Dynamics) -- the "training ground"
3. **Data infrastructure** (Scale AI Physical, Qualia, Neuracore) -- the "fuel"
4. **Safety/verification** (Voyage Robotics) -- the "guardrail"

This is why software-first companies are attracting the highest valuations. Skild AI ($14B) makes no hardware. Physical Intelligence ($5.6B) makes no hardware. They build intelligence layers that plug into any robot body.

### 5.2 Foundation Models are Changing the Economics

Pre-2023: Every robotics company built its own perception/control stack from scratch. The marginal cost of adding a new task was high. Deployments were brittle.

Post-2024: VLA models enable a robot to learn new tasks from a few demonstrations rather than months of engineering. The architectures (pi-zero, Helix, Groot) combine vision, language understanding, and motor control in a single model. This means:

- **Faster deployment:** Hours instead of months to teach a new task
- **Cross-embodiment transfer:** The same model can control an arm, a humanoid, or a mobile robot
- **Data flywheel:** Each deployment generates training data that improves the model for all users
- **Platform economics:** The foundation model layer captures value like an operating system

### 5.3 Pre-Seed/Seed Companies Emerging NOW

The most interesting pre-seed/seed-stage companies in robotics right now:

**Robot Learning Infrastructure:**
- Qualia (Denmark, pre-seed) -- VLA deployment infrastructure
- Neuracore (UK, EUR 2.5M pre-seed) -- unified robot learning platform
- Saturn Dynamics (UK, pre-seed) -- physics-aware generative simulator

**Manipulation/Dexterity:**
- Mimic (Switzerland, EUR 17M seed) -- dexterous hands from ETH Zurich
- Sunrise Robotics (Slovenia, $8.5M seed) -- autonomous manufacturing cells

**Defense/Security:**
- Kova Labs (Finland, pre-seed) -- embodied AI for defense
- Rollo Robotics (Estonia, EUR 3.7M pre-seed) -- autonomous security robots
- ARX Robotics (Germany, EUR 31M Series A) -- unmanned ground systems

**Physical AI Full Stack:**
- MAKIINA (Finland, seed) -- modular HW/SW stack, dual arms for <$1,200
- Levtek (Sweden, EUR 2.25M seed) -- ultralight EVs + collaborative robots

### 5.4 The Unicorn Factory

Forty-six companies founded in the past three years achieved unicorn status in 2025 ([Source](https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/funding-zero-to-unicorn-ai-robotics-eoy-2025/)). Several were robotics companies:

- **The Bot Company** -- $2B valuation from $300M total raised (founded 2024)
- **Figure AI** -- $39B valuation (founded 2022)
- **Skild AI** -- $14B valuation (founded 2023)
- **Physical Intelligence** -- $5.6B valuation (founded 2024)
- **FieldAI** -- $2B valuation (founded 2023)
- **Dexterity** -- $1.65B valuation

The speed of these valuation jumps is unprecedented in hardware-adjacent sectors and reflects the market treating robotics foundation models like software companies.

## 6. Key Investor Trends

### 6.1 Who's Most Active

**Mega-investors leading robotics rounds:**
- **SoftBank** -- led Skild AI ($1.4B), made robotics a strategic priority
- **NVentures (NVIDIA)** -- participated in Figure, Skild, FieldAI, Flexion, and others; NVIDIA's ecosystem strategy
- **Bezos Expeditions** -- FieldAI, Physical Intelligence, Skild AI; Jeff Bezos personally
- **Khosla Ventures** -- Genesis AI (co-led), FieldAI; active in European deals
- **Lightspeed** -- Dexterity, RobCo (led Series B + C); crossing from US to Europe
- **Lux Capital** -- Physical Intelligence; deep tech specialist
- **Eclipse** -- Genesis AI (co-led); robotics/industrial focus
- **DST Global** -- Flexion (led); not typically associated with hardware

**Corporate strategics increasingly active:**
- **Google/Alphabet** -- Apptronik; DeepMind robotics research
- **Mercedes-Benz** -- Apptronik
- **Amazon** -- Acquired Covariant; invested in Agility Robotics
- **BMW** -- RobCo deployment partner
- **Samsung** -- FieldAI
- **Tether** -- Neura Robotics (talks for EUR 1B round)

### 6.2 Seed vs. Growth Stage Dynamics

The market is bifurcating:

**Growth stage ($100M+):** Dominated by a handful of US companies (Figure, Skild, Physical Intelligence, FieldAI, Apptronik). These rounds are largely led by crossover investors (SoftBank Vision Fund, Tiger Global, T. Rowe Price) and strategic corporates. European companies rarely access these rounds without US-based co-leads.

**Early stage (pre-seed to Series A):** More geographically distributed. European VCs (Earlybird, Speedinvest, Elaia, FOV, Redalpine, Prototype) are actively funding robotics at this stage. Check sizes for pre-seed range from EUR 1-5M, well within Lunar's range.

**The pipeline is maturing:** Hard2beat VC notes "fewer pre-seed [deals], stronger pre-seed-to-B progression; Series A ~2.3x vs 2015" -- meaning early-stage robotics companies are graduating to follow-on rounds at higher rates than ever before.

### 6.3 European vs. US Funding Gap

| Metric | US | Europe | Gap |
|--------|-----|--------|-----|
| 2025 total robotics VC | ~$11-12B (est.) | ~EUR 1.1B (~$1.2B) | ~10x |
| Largest single round | $1.4B (Skild) | EUR 120M (Neura) | ~12x |
| Number of robotics unicorns | 6+ | 0-1 (1X at $10B if counted) | Massive |
| Pre-seed/seed activity | High | Growing fast | Closing |

The gap is structural at growth stage but narrowing at early stage. European research output in robotics is world-class (ETH Zurich, INRIA, Imperial, KTH), and the translation from lab to company is accelerating.

## 7. Implications for Lunar Ventures

### Where the Opportunity Is

1. **Robot learning infrastructure** (Qualia, Saturn Dynamics, Neuracore-type plays): The data/simulation layer is underfunded relative to its importance. Every robotics company needs training data, simulation environments, and deployment tooling. This is the "picks and shovels" play.

2. **Defense robotics in Europe** (Kova Labs, ARX Robotics-type plays): European defense budgets are surging, and autonomous systems are a priority. This maps directly to Lunar's defense/aerospace thesis.

3. **Domain-specific manipulation** (Mimic, Sereact, Sunrise Robotics-type plays): Rather than general-purpose humanoids, companies focused on specific high-value manipulation tasks (manufacturing QA, assembly, logistics picking) have clearer paths to revenue.

4. **Sim-to-real infrastructure** (Genesis AI already raised at scale, but the layer underneath -- physics engines, synthetic data generators, digital twins -- is still fragmented and pre-seed-accessible).

### Where to Be Careful

1. **General-purpose humanoids:** The billion-dollar rounds mean the winners are already well-capitalized. A EUR 1-2M pre-seed in a new humanoid company is competing against Figure ($1.9B raised), Apptronik ($935M), and 1X ($100M+ with $1B coming). Unless there's a genuinely differentiated approach, this is not Lunar's game.

2. **Foundation models:** Skild ($1.83B), Physical Intelligence ($1.07B), FieldAI ($405M), and Genesis ($105M) are well-funded. New foundation model companies need a sharply differentiated angle (e.g., domain-specific models for defense, or radically more data-efficient architectures).

3. **Valuation inflation:** The Figure 15x valuation jump in 7 months is a warning sign. Pre-seed robotics valuations in Europe are still reasonable (EUR 5-15M pre-money), but any company positioning itself as "the European Figure" will attract growth-stage expectations at seed.

### Bottom Line

The robotics market is experiencing a genuine technology inflection (foundation models + cheap hardware + labor scarcity) combined with a speculative funding bubble at growth stage. The best Lunar play is to invest in the enabling infrastructure layers at pre-seed in Europe -- the companies that every robotics developer will need, regardless of which humanoid company "wins."
