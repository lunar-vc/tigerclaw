## Executive Summary

This report provides in-depth profiles of 10 robotics companies (5 specifically requested, 5 major reference companies) plus a scan of notable European early-stage robotics startups. The robotics landscape is experiencing record capital inflows — global robotics funding hit $13.8B in 2025, up from $7.8B in 2024 — driven by foundation model breakthroughs and humanoid hype. The market bifurcates into: (a) hyper-funded US companies building foundation models and humanoids ($1B+ rounds), and (b) European/Israeli early-stage companies attacking specific niches (dexterous manipulation, VLA ops, robot data infra, cognitive robotics). For Lunar's pre-seed/seed mandate, the European cluster is where the opportunity lives.

## Part 1: Targeted Company Profiles

---

### 1. Mentee Robotics

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | Herzliya, Israel |
| **Founded** | 2021-2022 |
| **Stage** | Acquired ($900M by Mobileye, Jan 2026) |
| **Category** | Humanoid robots (hardware + AI) |
| **European** | No (Israeli) |

**Founders:**
- **Prof. Amnon Shashua** — Co-founder & Chair. Founder of Mobileye (sold to Intel for $15.3B in 2017) and AI21 Labs. Serial entrepreneur with deep computer vision expertise.
- **Prof. Lior Wolf** — Co-founder. Formerly research scientist and director at Facebook AI Research (FAIR). Faculty at Tel Aviv University.
- **Prof. Shai Shalev-Shwartz** — Co-founder. ML professor at Hebrew University. Former VP of technology at Mobileye. Co-authored foundational ML textbook.

**What they build:** Humanoid robot called MenteeBot. Full-stack approach: perception, reasoning, and whole-body control. The approach uses synthetic data generation — converting a single human demonstration into millions of virtual repetitions for sim-to-real transfer. Target use: household chores, warehouse tasks, general-purpose humanoid work.

**Funding history:**
- Total raised: ~$17M (from founders and Ahren Innovation Capital, Hookipa AG, Doron Sagie)
- Notably capital-efficient for a humanoid company

**Key development:** Mobileye announced acquisition for $900M at CES 2026 (Jan 6, 2026). Deal structure: $612M cash + up to 26.2M Mobileye Class A shares. Expected to close Q1 2026. Mentee will operate as an independent unit within Mobileye. First proof-of-concept deployments expected in 2026, series production and commercialization to follow.

**Sources:**

- [StartuphubAI — funding](https://www.startuphub.ai/mentee-robotics-raised-17-million-for-their-humanoid-robot-menteebot/)

**Lunar relevance:** Acquired. Not investable. But notable as proof that Israeli humanoid robotics teams can generate $900M exits on just $17M raised. Shashua's involvement was the differentiator — tier-1 founding team + Mobileye's sensing IP created a natural acquirer.

### 2. Fauna Robotics

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | New York City, USA (Flatiron District) |
| **Founded** | 2024 |
| **Stage** | Series B (claims $30M raised per Twitter; Tracxn shows $16.6M disclosed) |
| **Category** | Humanoid robot platform (hardware + software) |
| **European** | No (US) |

**Founders:**
- **Rob Cochran** — Co-founder & CEO. Background in product shipping and company building.
- **Josh Merel** — Co-founder & CTO. Former DeepMind research scientist. Expert in movement neuroscience and robot learning.
- **Lerrel Pinto** — Co-founder. Professor at NYU. Renowned robotics researcher focused on general-purpose manipulation and robot learning. Multiple PhD students have gone on to work at Fauna, 1X, and NVIDIA.

**What they build:** Sprout — a 3.5-foot (1m) tall, lightweight, foam-covered humanoid robot platform. Deliberately designed to be approachable (not intimidating). Targets home, classroom, and social environments rather than industrial. Shipping as "Creator Edition" for $50,000. Sprout is a developer platform — brings modern developer workflows to robotics so teams can move from idea to prototype without reinventing fundamentals. Modular AI integration. Safety-first design with soft padded exterior.

**Funding:**
- Disclosed round: $16.6M (Feb 2025, SEC filing shows 28 investors)
- Company claims $30M total raised (per Twitter, Jan 2026)
- Investors: Kleiner Perkins, Lux Capital, Quiet Capital, Village Global, Bluebirds Capital, Terrain
- Tracxn classifies as "Series B" despite youth — likely seed + follow-on structure

**Sources:**
- [AP News — Sprout launch](https://apnews.com/article/friendly-home-robot-fauna-robotics-sprout-57b396cd6f4b98ef83913a5efa9e0db2)
- [Fauna Robotics — Sprout launch](https://faunarobotics.com/news/fauna-robotics-launches-sprout-the-easiest-way-to-build-with-humanoids)
- [Robot Report — Sprout platform](https://www.therobotreport.com/introducing-sprout-a-new-humanoid-development-platform/)
- [Yann LeCun tweet endorsing Fauna](https://x.com/ylecun/status/1763677946965893345)
- [Lerrel Pinto's group page showing Fauna connections](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/group/)

**Lunar relevance:** Too late (well-funded by KP/Lux, US-based). But noteworthy as a platform play — they're building the "developer platform for humanoids" rather than a vertically integrated robot company. The Lerrel Pinto connection is significant: he's one of the most prolific robotics professors at NYU and his lab is a pipeline for Fauna talent.

### 3. Minerva (Robotics)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | Unknown / ambiguous |
| **Founded** | Unknown |
| **Stage** | Unknown |
| **Category** | Unknown |
| **European** | Unknown |

**Research finding:** No clear match for a notable robotics startup called "Minerva" from 2024-2026 that fits the context of the "current wave" of robotics companies. Searches returned:
- **Minerva Robotics** — a digital marketing and crowdfunding agency (not a robot company)
- **Minerva (CMU)** — a historical Carnegie Mellon research project from the 1990s
- **Minerva (Polish SaaS)** — a B2B procurement platform ($3M raised)

This may be a company still in stealth, or the name may be slightly different. Could also refer to a company that was recently renamed. If you have additional context (e.g., a URL, founder name, or specific domain), I can dig deeper.

### 4. Qualia Studios

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | Copenhagen, Denmark (also Sweden-based co-founder) |
| **Founded** | 2025 |
| **Stage** | Pre-seed |
| **Category** | Robotics software / VLA ops platform |
| **European** | Yes (Denmark/Sweden) |

**Founders:**
- **Fabian Kerj** — Co-founder. Background in philosophy of consciousness/AI (PhilPeople profile). King's College London educated. Also worked in venture capital. Describes himself as developing "generative technologies through Qualia Studios while working full-time in venture capital."
- **Max Fallstrom** — Co-founder (Sweden-based)
- **Oscar Cortina** — Co-founder (Denmark-based)
- **Ludvig Erikson Brangstrup** — Co-founder (Sweden-based)

**What they build:** VLA (Vision-Language-Action) ops platform called Q-Core. Purpose-built GPU cloud infrastructure for training, fine-tuning, and deploying frontier-class VLA models for robotics. Supports models including Pi 0.5, SmolVLA, and Gr00t 1.5. Targets robotics engineers and hardware companies who need infrastructure to go from model selection to deployment.

Nordic 9 describes them as: "a robotics software startup developing a spatial agent tasks framework for robotic digital twins."

Their company registration (Qualia ApS, CVR 45685985) states purpose: "to build development tools for robotics and spatial AI."

**Funding:** No publicly disclosed funding. Listed as pre-seed by FOV Ventures. The company was named in FOV Ventures' "10 Early-Stage Startups to Watch in 2026" list. Twitter profile (@QualiaRobotics) is active.

**Sources:**
- [Nordic9 — company profile](https://nordic9.com/companies/qualia-studios/)
- [FOV Ventures — 10 startups to watch](https://viewpoints.fov.ventures/p/10-early-stage-startups-to-watch-in-2026)
- [Qualia website](https://qualiastudios.dev/)
- [PhilPeople — Fabian Kerj](https://philpeople.org/profiles/fabian-kerj)
- [NorthData — company registration](https://www.northdata.com/Qualia%20ApS,%20K%C3%B8benhavn/CVR%2045685985)

**Lunar relevance:** HIGH INTEREST. Pre-seed Danish/Swedish startup building VLA infrastructure tooling. This is the robotics equivalent of "MLOps for foundation models" — horizontal platform play enabling any robotics team to train and deploy VLA models. Very early. The co-founder working in VC while building this is a yellow flag (part-time founder risk?). Small founding team with mixed technical/philosophical backgrounds — would want to verify depth of ML/systems engineering capability. The VLA tooling thesis is strong: as Pi0, SmolVLA, and Gr00t proliferate, every robotics company will need deployment infrastructure. Geography (Copenhagen) is right. Stage (pre-seed) is right. Needs diligence on: (a) is Fabian full-time now?, (b) technical depth of team, (c) funding status, (d) differentiation vs Rerun, Neuracore, and other robotics infra plays.

### 5. Baseline Robotics

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | Unknown (possibly ETH Zurich-connected) |
| **Founded** | Unknown |
| **Stage** | Unknown |
| **Category** | Robot data collection |
| **European** | Likely (Swiss) |

**Research finding:** No public results found for "Baseline Robotics" as a startup focused on robot data collection, including searches for "Georges Pantalos" as a founder. The ETH Zurich Robotic Systems Lab (RSL) and Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL) have extensive spinout lists, but "Baseline Robotics" does not appear among them. The GitHub organization "leggedrobotics" (RSL's account) has a repo called "terra-baselines" but this appears to be a research project, not a company.

This company may be: (a) still in deep stealth/pre-launch, (b) under a different name, or (c) a very early-stage project that hasn't yet incorporated. If you have a URL, LinkedIn, or additional founder details, I can investigate further.

### 6. Physical Intelligence (Pi)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | San Francisco, USA |
| **Founded** | 2024 |
| **Stage** | Growth (Series B equivalent; $1.1B+ total raised) |
| **Category** | Robot foundation models / VLA |
| **European** | No (US) |

**Founders:**
- **Karol Hausman** — CEO & Co-founder. Former Staff Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. Adjunct Professor at Stanford. Focused on general-purpose robot skills.
- **Chelsea Finn** — Co-founder. Assistant Professor at Stanford. Pioneer in meta-learning and few-shot learning for robotics.
- **Sergey Levine** — Co-founder. Associate Professor at UC Berkeley. Among the most cited researchers in deep RL and robot learning.
- **Brian Ichter** — Co-founder. Former Google research scientist. Worked with Hausman at Google.
- **Lachy Groom** — Co-founder. Former Stripe executive / fintech veteran. Business/product side.
- Additional co-founders: Adnan Esmail, Quan Vuong

**What they build:** Foundation models for robotic manipulation and general-purpose physical interaction. Their flagship model, Pi0 (pi-zero), is a "generalist policy" — a single neural network that can control diverse robots across diverse tasks. Released Pi0 as open-source (code + weights) in Feb 2025. The thesis: just as LLMs provide a foundation for language, Pi0 provides a foundation model for physical intelligence. Combines multi-task, multi-robot data with vision-language model architectures.

**Funding:**
- Seed: $70M (2024)
- Series A: $400M at $2.4B valuation (2024, led by Jeff Bezos)
- Series B: $600M at $5.6B valuation (Nov 2025, led by Google CapitalG, Jeff Bezos participation)
- **Total: ~$1.1B raised**

**Sources:**
- [Pi website](https://www.pi.website/)
- [Robot Report — $600M raise](https://www.therobotreport.com/physical-intelligence-raises-600m-advance-robot-foundation-models/)
- [WIRED — Inside Pi](https://www.wired.com/story/physical-intelligence-ai-robotics-startup/)

- [EUTechFuture — funding explained](https://eutechfuture.com/artificial-intelligence/physical-intelligence-building-foundation-models-for-robots-to-interact-with-the-real-world/)

**Lunar relevance:** Way too late. $5.6B valuation. But critically important as the upstream model provider that creates the market for companies like Qualia (VLA ops) and Neuracore (robot learning infra). Pi0 going open-source is a major enabler for the European robotics ecosystem — every downstream company building on VLA models benefits from Pi's research.

### 7. Skild AI

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA |
| **Founded** | 2023 |
| **Stage** | Series C ($1.81B total raised, $14B valuation) |
| **Category** | Robot foundation models |
| **European** | No (US) |

**Founders:**
- **Deepak Pathak** — CEO & Co-founder. Former assistant professor at CMU Robotics Institute. Left tenured position. PhD from UC Berkeley. Research: self-supervised learning, robot learning. 30,000+ citations.
- **Abhinav Gupta** — President & Co-founder. Former CMU Robotics Institute professor. Background at Facebook AI Research (FAIR). UMD PhD.

**What they build:** "Skild Brain" — a general-purpose foundation model specifically designed to power robots. Claims their model is trained on more complex and diverse data than competitors. The model can control quadrupeds, humanoids, drones, and manipulators with a single architecture. Revenue reportedly grew from zero to ~$30M in just months during 2025.

**Funding:**
- Seed: ~$14M (2023)
- Series A: $300M (Jul 2024, led by Lightspeed, Coatue, SoftBank, Bezos Expeditions)
- Series B: ~$100M (Jun 2025)
- Series C: ~$1.4B (Jan 2026, led by SoftBank, NVentures/Nvidia, Jeff Bezos)
- **Total: ~$1.81B raised at $14B+ valuation**

**Sources:**
- [BusinessWire — $1.4B raise](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260114335623/en/Skild-AI-Raises-$1.4B-Now-Valued-Over-$14B)
- [TechCrunch — $14B valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/robotic-software-maker-skild-ai-hits-14b-valuation/)
- [Sequoia — partnership](https://sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-skild/)
- [Skild blog — Series A](https://www.skild.ai/blogs/announcing-our-300m-series-a)
- [Skild blog — revenue growth](https://www.skild.ai/blogs/series-c)

**Lunar relevance:** Way too late. $14B valuation. Direct competitor to Physical Intelligence. Both are building the "brains" that other robotics companies will use. The CMU-to-company pipeline (Pathak + Gupta leaving tenured positions) is a pattern worth monitoring — CMU RI is one of the richest sources of robotics founder talent.

### 8. Covariant (now Amazon)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | Emeryville, California, USA |
| **Founded** | 2017 (as Embodied Intelligence) |
| **Stage** | Acqui-hired by Amazon (Aug/Sep 2024) |
| **Category** | Robot manipulation / foundation models |
| **European** | No (US) |

**Founders:**
- **Pieter Abbeel** — President & Chief Scientist. UC Berkeley professor. One of the most prominent robotics/RL researchers globally. Co-founded Gradescope. Former OpenAI research scientist.
- **Peter Chen** — Co-founder.
- **Rocky Duan** — Co-founder.
- **Tianhao Zhang** — Co-founder.

**What they built:** Started in warehouse robotic manipulation (picking/sorting), evolved into building robotics foundation models. Launched RFM-1 (Robotics Foundation Model 1) in March 2024 — an 8B parameter model trained on tens of millions of real-world robot trajectories. Operated a large fleet of warehouse robots to collect training data.

**Funding:**
- Series A: $7M (2019)
- Series B: $40M (2021)
- Series C (round 1): $80M (2021)
- Series C (round 2): $75M (2023, co-led by Index Ventures)
- **Total: ~$222M raised**

**Outcome:** Amazon acqui-hired Abbeel, Chen, Duan and ~25% of employees in August 2024. Amazon licensed Covariant's foundation models non-exclusively. The remaining Covariant entity still holds IP and continues as a company (the models are licensed, not sold).

**Sources:**
- [Wikipedia — Covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_(company))
- [Amazon announcement](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-covariant-ai-robots)
- [TechCrunch — acqui-hire](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/31/amazon-hires-the-founders-of-robotics-ai-startup-covariant/)
- [Index Ventures — Series C](https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/congratulations-to-covariant-on-their-75m-series-c/)

**Lunar relevance:** Done (acqui-hired). But important historical context — Covariant proved the "data flywheel" approach: deploy robots at scale in warehouses to collect manipulation data, then train foundation models on that real-world data. This is the playbook that Physical Intelligence and Skild are now executing at larger scale.

### 9. 1X Technologies

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | Palo Alto, CA (operations) / Moss, Norway (originally) |
| **Founded** | 2014 (as Halodi Robotics) |
| **Stage** | Series B+ (seeking $1B additional funding) |
| **Category** | Humanoid robots (hardware + AI) |
| **European** | Yes (Norwegian origin, now dual US/Norway) |

**Founders:**
- **Bernt Oyvind Bornich** — Founder & CEO. Norwegian roboticist. University of Oslo (Robotics & Nanoelectronics). Has been building humanoid robots since founding the company in 2014. Originally named the company Halodi Robotics.

**What they build:** Two humanoid robots:
- **EVE** — Wheeled humanoid designed for industrial/institutional use (logistics, security). Already deployed.
- **NEO** — Full bipedal humanoid designed for homes. 3.5-foot form factor. Currently relies on human teleoperation (users must accept this for 2026 deliveries) while autonomous capabilities improve. Priced at $20,000 purchase or $499/month subscription. Pre-orders open, delivery starting 2026 in US.

**Funding:**
- Early rounds (2017-2022): ~$2.5M seed/early
- Series A2: $23.5M (Mar 2023, led by OpenAI Startup Fund + Tiger Global)
- Series B: $100M (Jan 2024, led by EQT Ventures + Samsung NEXT)
- **Total: ~$126M raised**
- Seeking $1B additional (reported Sep 2025)

**Key deal:** Strategic partnership with EQT (Dec 2025) to deploy up to 10,000 NEO humanoids across EQT's 300+ portfolio companies (2026-2030) for manufacturing, warehousing, logistics.

**Sources:**
- [1X website](https://www.1x.tech/)
- [Wikipedia — 1X Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1X_Technologies)
- [Sifted — in-home humanoids](https://sifted.eu/articles/1x-humanoid-robot-launch)
- [1X — Series B announcement](https://www.1x.tech/discover/1x-secures-100m-in-series-b-funding)
- [TechCrunch — EQT deal](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/1x-struck-a-deal-to-send-its-home-humanoids-to-factories-and-warehouses/)

**Lunar relevance:** Too late for investment (Series B+, $126M raised, seeking $1B more). But important as the leading European-origin humanoid company. 1X's Norwegian roots and EQT partnership demonstrate that Europe can produce world-class humanoid robotics companies. The teleoperation-first approach (shipping NEO with human operators while autonomy improves) is an interesting go-to-market strategy that other European startups may adopt.

### 10. Figure AI

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | San Jose, California, USA |
| **Founded** | 2022 |
| **Stage** | Series C ($1.75B total raised, $39B valuation) |
| **Category** | Humanoid robots (hardware + AI) |
| **European** | No (US) |

**Founders:**
- **Brett Adcock** — Founder & CEO. Serial entrepreneur. Previously co-founded Archer Aviation (eVTOL, $1.5B United Airlines deal) and Vettery (talent marketplace). Self-funded the company's initial $100M seed.

**What they build:** General-purpose autonomous humanoid robots (Figure 01, Figure 02, Figure 03). Full-body bipedal humanoid for commercial and home use. Partnership with BMW for factory deployment. Working toward using its own humanoids to help build more humanoids. Figure 03 designed for household use.

**Funding:**
- Seed: ~$100M (self-funded by Adcock, 2022-2023)
- Series A: $70M (May 2023, led by Parkway VC; $500M valuation)
- Series B: $675M (Feb 2024; $2.6B valuation; Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Jeff Bezos, OpenAI, Amazon)
- Series C: $1B+ (Sep 2025; $39B valuation)
- **Total: ~$1.75B+ raised**

**Sources:**
- [Figure AI — Series C](https://www.figure.ai/news/series-c)
- [Reuters — $39B valuation](https://www.reuters.com/business/robotics-startup-figure-valued-39-billion-latest-funding-round-2025-09-16/)
- [Wikipedia — Figure AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_AI)
- [Wikipedia — Brett Adcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Adcock)

**Lunar relevance:** Way too late. $39B valuation is the highest in humanoid robotics. Useful only as a reference point — the "north star" that every humanoid startup pitches against.

## Part 2: Notable European Early-Stage Robotics Companies (2024-2026)

These are the companies most relevant to Lunar's pre-seed/seed mandate.

---

### Flexion Robotics (Switzerland)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | Zurich, Switzerland |
| **Founded** | Jan 2025 |
| **Stage** | Series A ($57.35M total) |
| **Funding** | Seed: $7.35M (Frst, Moonfire, Redalpine); Series A: $50M (DST Global Partners, NVentures/Nvidia, Redalpine, Prosus, Moonfire) |
| **Category** | Humanoid robot brain / autonomy stack |

**Founders:**
- **Nikita Rudin** — CEO. Former Nvidia researcher. ETH Zurich background.
- **David Hoeller** — CTO. Former Nvidia researcher.
- **Julian Nubert** — Co-founder. ETH Zurich.
- **Fabian Tischhauser** — Co-founder.
- **Marco Hutter** — Co-founder (likely advisor/professor). Head of RSL at ETH Zurich.

**What they build:** Reinforcement-learning-based autonomy stack for humanoid robots. Transformer-based whole-body control. Trains in high-fidelity simulators to reduce reliance on human demonstrations. "We're building the brain, not the body." Hardware-agnostic — works across different humanoid platforms.

**Sources:** [Crunchbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/robotic-brain-building-startup-flexion-raise/) | [Flexion blog](https://flexion.ai/news/flexion-raises-50m-to-build-the-brain-of-humanoid-robots-at-scale)

**Lunar relevance:** Too late (already $57M in, DST/Nvidia lead). But shows ETH Zurich RSL is a top-tier spinout factory for robotics. Watch for earlier-stage RSL spinouts.

---

### Mimic Robotics (Switzerland)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | Zurich, Switzerland |
| **Founded** | 2024 (ETH Zurich spin-off) |
| **Stage** | Seed ($20M+ total) |
| **Funding** | Pre-seed: $2.5M; Seed: $16M (led by Elaia + Speedinvest, with Founderful, 1st Kind, 10X Founders, 2100, Sequoia Scout) |
| **Category** | Dexterous manipulation / AI robotic hands |

**Founders:**
- **Stefan Weirich** — CEO
- **Stephan-Daniel Gravert** — Co-founder
- **Elvis Nava** — Co-founder
- **Benedek Forrai** — Co-founder
- **Robert Katzschmann** — Scientific Advisor (ETH professor, Soft Robotics Lab)

**What they build:** AI-driven dexterous robotic hands that pair with off-the-shelf robot arms. Their thesis: "Humanoids are exciting, but there aren't many industrial scenarios where the full-body form factor truly adds value." Focus on deployable manipulation rather than full humanoid. Foundation model for dexterous grasping trained from human demonstrations. 25-person team. Running pilot programs in manufacturing, automotive, logistics, retail.

**Sources:** [Sifted — seed raise](https://sifted.eu/articles/eth-robotics-spinout-mimic-raises-16m-seed) | [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/news-and-events/ai-center-news/2025/09/mimic_Robotics_Seed_Round_2025.html)

**Lunar relevance:** Possible but likely too late (seed already done at $16M with Speedinvest/Elaia). Good thesis though — "dexterous hands, not humanoids" is a more practical near-term path.

### Neuracore (UK)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | London, UK |
| **Founded** | 2024 |
| **Stage** | Pre-seed ($3M) |
| **Funding** | $3M pre-seed led by Earlybird Venture Capital. Angels include Clem Delangue (Hugging Face CEO) |
| **Category** | Robot learning infrastructure / MLOps for robotics |

**Founders:**
- **Stephen James** — CEO & Founder. Assistant Professor of Robot Learning at Imperial College London (Safe Whole-body Intelligent Robotics Lab — SWIRL).

**What they build:** Unified robot learning platform replacing fragmented "Frankenstein" stacks of ad-hoc ROS nodes, custom data stores, and one-off training rigs. One platform for data collection, model training, and fleet deployment. In use across 50+ organizations including commercial robotics teams and top research labs. Also runs a free academic program. Cloud-native deployment to entire robot fleets. Fine-tuning of robot foundation models.

**Sources:** [EU-Startups](https://www.eu-startups.com/2025/11/londons-neuracore-raises-e2-5-million-to-replace-frankenstein-robotics-stacks-with-unified-robot-learning-infrastructure/) | [Tech.eu](https://tech.eu/2025/11/27/neuracore-raises-3m-to-power-next-gen-robots-and-open-robotics-research/) | [Stephen James bio](https://stepjam.github.io/bio/)

**Lunar relevance:** INTERESTING but likely too late for Lunar's check size (Earlybird already in at pre-seed). Similar thesis to Qualia but different focus: Neuracore is broader robot learning infra, Qualia is specifically VLA ops. Both are "picks and shovels" plays for the robotics foundation model wave. Stephen James's Imperial affiliation is strong.

### Allonic (Hungary)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **HQ** | Budapest, Hungary |
| **Founded** | 2021-2025 (conflicting sources; EU-Startups says 2021, Vestbee says 2025) |
| **Stage** | Pre-seed ($7.2M — Hungary's largest ever pre-seed) |
| **Funding** | $7.2M led by Visionaries Club + Day One Capital. Angels from OpenAI, Hugging Face, ETH Zurich, Northwestern University |
| **Category** | Robotic body manufacturing |

**Founders:**
- **Benedek Tasi** — CEO
- **David Pelyva** — CTO
- **David Hollo** — CPO

**What they build:** "3D Tissue Braiding" — an automated manufacturing platform for producing complex, bio-inspired robotic bodies. Replaces manual assembly with a fully automated process that weaves fibers, elastics, and embedded wiring over an endoskeleton in a single continuous operation. Think: manufacturing infrastructure for the humanoid wave. If every company is building robot brains, someone needs to efficiently manufacture the bodies.

**Lunar relevance:** INTERESTING thesis (picks-and-shovels for robot body manufacturing). $7.2M pre-seed is large but they're EU-based and attacking manufacturing infra — adjacent to Lunar's computational materials lens. Already funded though (Visionaries Club + Day One). Worth tracking the space — who else is building robotics manufacturing tooling?

### Where Lunar's Opportunity Lives

Given Lunar's mandate (European pre-seed/seed, $1-2M checks, 10% target):

1. **VLA ops / robotics infra** — Qualia Studios (Copenhagen, pre-seed, no disclosed funding yet) is the most stage-appropriate target. Neuracore (London, $3M pre-seed) may be accessible for co-investment.

2. **Defense robotics** — Kova Labs (Finland, pre-seed, Lifeline-backed) directly overlaps with Lunar's defense theme. Embodied intelligence for unmanned systems.

3. **Early ETH/EPFL spinouts** — The Swiss university pipeline is the densest in Europe. Mimic and Flexion are already funded, but the next wave of RSL/ASL spinouts is where the alpha is. Monitor Marco Hutter's lab specifically.

4. **Manufacturing/vertical robotics** — Sitegeist (Munich, €4M pre-seed, construction robots) overlaps with industrial OT. Paddington (UK, grocery robots) is consumer-facing.

5. **Robot body manufacturing** — Allonic's thesis (manufacturing infrastructure for the humanoid wave) is compelling and adjacent to computational materials. Already funded ($7.2M) but the category is nascent.
